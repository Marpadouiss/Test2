He lifts the fist in the air. "Hala Madrid!!!" (smile). I am super content. It is the victory of Zidane it wants to say that it is a little the victory of the northern districts of Marseille. Laughter. No, I laugh. It is true that Zidane, what happens to him, is a trick of crazy. He has won the Champions League, he also won as a coach its first year. That is--ce which lacks? It lacks that it causes a basketball club and he earns a championship in France, huh? It is beautiful. Yet the Atletico on the ground, it is of the dogs. If thou art not with them, you're forced to hate. They do fail nothing on the ground and as I am for the real, I hate them. Laughter..

What place has the HBP in your life?

The HBP is a passion. I think that I will have difficulty to get rid of it. The RAP was not made not that well. It brings me also much of jealousy, I lost some relationships because of it. There are people who fantasment on the middle of the music but I find it of the times, between quotation marks, almost satanic. I do not say that the sooner I stop better I will wear, because I kiffe too it brothel of shit. Will be necessary well that one day it stops. It is since the success that I am Overview. When thou rappes that for the passion, thou art as a child, thou art passionate. But when the money, marriage, children and the eyes of others come into consideration, it becomes much more complicated: as you please or not, thou hast not the same life as the other. I know very well that when I go out of my home, even if I am Natural, people will see the Alonzo of clips. It is sometimes exhausting to bring this carapace.

Çe?will be what the signal that will make you stop the HBP?

I would like my relatives, connoisseurs of the rap, tell me: "hangs up y 'has nothing more to do." I account on them and I think that this will be that the signal. Because today my sales are going crescendo. Nobody can say the opposite. "I am not a character." Five years of prison in shoulder strap, Karim Zenoud, alias Lacrim, her first album, "Corléone", among Def Jam. Its hoarse voice, the rapper of 29 years speaks of his years in prison, of the preparation of his album and its future Mixtape.
Before even its exit, your album is hauling in the third Sales rank digitales. You are surprised by this success?

Lacrim - Yes, I was not expecting this at all. My only concern was to make an album consisting. After, I am only responsible for 50% of my success, it is the public who does the rest.

We feel also a big media waiting…

Yes it is true. Laurent Bouneau (Director General of programs of Skyrock - NDLR) has liked the album, it affects me. I have carried out four street-albums before the output of this album and I think that some sounds would undoubtedly have been able to find their place in radio but I was in the indie and I had not at all the same visibility that today in having signed with Def Jam.

Among the reasons that explain your success, it evokes also thy proximity and thy local anchoring…

I have done a great job of proximity in the upstream. The people of neighborhoods to feel that I am like them, that I do not surjoue. In 2012, I made a tour de France of neighborhoods. I gave appointment to people thanks to social networks and without no relay in the media and the public met still present. Word of mouth was operating at the bottom. But I do not claim to become a star and I do not want to be. I want to stay simple and natural.

On your title "Pocket Coffee", you say: "The guys like me in the rap there is little but in the cities there are thousands". Why hast thou the feeling to be different?

It is the public who m feel different. I have a lot struggle and it must be felt. My journey looks like a lot of young people in the cities. People say to me "Guys like you who have struggle, there has not in the Rap", I am of the agreement. I am one of the first or one of the only. Lacrim, it is entirely me; what I said in my music, that is what I have lived. The dropping out of school at 11 years, the five prison sentences which I have received, the sadness that I imposed to my parents. There has been a lot of fog in my life.



What strikes in your album, is the quality of the prods of Kore, including on the titles "Street", "Oz" or "My Glock TE will knees". It's been a long time that you work with him?

I met Kore before that I am working on this album. I had participated in the compilation R'nB fever 4 at the time and a project with his little brother Bellek DJ. After that, our paths were a little separated. But even at a distance, he continued to follow my evolution, to listen to my texts and he had the desire that it reworks together. I immediately attached to its universe. I like the fact that it is crazy, that it is not at all French in his artistic sensitivity.

What are your favorite prods?

"Oz" and "we don't do that". I like "Corleone" also.

You had worked with therapy (producer of Booba then Kaaris) in 2013? Why it is stopped?

Ca has not stopped. Simply, I met Kore and I got everything that I needed. The alchemy was perfect so I have not sought other prods elsewhere. I te swear, when Kore is arrived with his palette of prod, I immediately typed my buttocks by earth.

Compared to your previous sounds, one has the impression that thou hast simplified your lyrics and that thou More Research The Emotion

Ca depends on the pieces in "Oz" Actually, I seeks the emotion. It is true that I have without doubt simplified my lyrics because sometimes when one wants to get out of rhymes very complex, it is to the detriment of the message. In general, I am seeking the perfect rhyme. For me, "Karim" and "gym" it does not rhyme together. And when thou seekest the rime perfect on a 2 or 4 measures, the message is not necessarily. You are obliged to disrupt the words to that it works. It is technical. (It is pretending to install an addition with its hands). If I place this word there, there must be one there, there-bottom. The HBP, it is of maths in fact.



Thou hast generalized use of the autotune also…

Yes I have a lot more put in the album that nowhere elsewhere. In my other EP, I had put that on a few songs. I put the autotune because I am not a singer. I listen to a lot of American sounds and I see that everyone puts. It is enough to think of the future, or French Montana.

Your title "Everybody Wants To of coiled" is quickly becoming a tube on the airwaves. You had designed as a song FM?

It lacks that it causes a basketball club and he earns a championship in France, huh? It is beautiful. Yet the Atletico on the ground, it is of the dogs. If thou art not with them, you're forced to hate. They do fail nothing on the ground and as I am for the real, I hate them. Laughter..

What place has the HBP in your life?

The HBP is a passion. I think that I will have difficulty to get rid of it. The RAP was not made not that well. It brings me also much of jealousy, I lost some relationships because of it. There are people who fantasment on the middle of the music but I find it of the times, between quotation marks, almost satanic. I do not say that the sooner I stop better I will wear, because I kiffe too it brothel of shit. Will be necessary well that one day it stops. It is since the success that I am Overview. When thou rappes that for the passion, thou art as a child, thou art passionate. But when the money, marriage, children and the eyes of others come into consideration, it becomes much more complicated: as you please or not, thou hast not the same life as the other. I know very well that when I go out of my home, even if I am Natural, people will see the Alonzo of clips. It is sometimes exhausting to bring this carapace.

Çe?will be what the signal that will make you stop the HBP?

I would like my relatives, connoisseurs of the rap, tell me: "hangs up y 'has nothing more to do." I account on them and I think that this will be that the signal. Because today my sales are going crescendo. Nobody can say the opposite. "I am not a character." Five years of prison in shoulder strap, Karim Zenoud, alias Lacrim, her first album, "Corléone", among Def Jam. Its hoarse voice, the rapper of 29 years speaks of his years in prison, of the preparation of his album and its future Mixtape.
Before even its exit, your album is hauling in the third Sales rank digitales. You are surprised by this success?

Lacrim - Yes, I was not expecting this at all. My only concern was to make an album consisting. After, I am only responsible for 50% of my success, it is the public who does the rest.

We feel also a big media waiting…

Yes it is true. Laurent Bouneau (Director General of programs of Skyrock - NDLR) has liked the album, it affects me. I have carried out four street-albums before the output of this album and I think that some sounds would undoubtedly have been able to find their place in radio but I was in the indie and I had not at all the same visibility that today in having signed with Def Jam.

Among the reasons that explain your success, it evokes also thy proximity and thy local anchoring…

I have done a great job of proximity in the upstream. The people of neighborhoods to feel that I am like them, that I do not surjoue. In 2012, I made a tour de France of neighborhoods. I gave appointment to people thanks to social networks and without no relay in the media and the public met still present. Word of mouth was operating at the bottom. But I do not claim to become a star and I do not want to be. I want to stay simple and natural.

On your title "Pocket Coffee", you say: "The guys like me in the rap there is little but in the cities there are thousands". Why hast thou the feeling to be different?

It is the public who m feel different. I have a lot struggle and it must be felt. My journey looks like a lot of young people in the cities. People say to me "Guys like you who have struggle, there has not in the Rap", I am of the agreement. I am one of the first or one of the only. Lacrim, it is entirely me; what I said in my music, that is what I have lived. The dropping out of school at 11 years, the five prison sentences which I have received, the sadness that I imposed to my parents. There has been a lot of fog in my life.



What strikes in your album, is the quality of the prods of Kore, including on the titles "Street", "Oz" or "My Glock TE will knees". It's been a long time that you work with him?

I met Kore before that I am working on this album. I had participated in the compilation R'nB fever 4 at the time and a project with his little brother Bellek DJ. After that, our paths were a little separated. But even at a distance, he continued to follow my evolution, to listen to my texts and he had the desire that it reworks together. I immediately attached to its universe. I like the fact that it is crazy, that it is not at all French in his artistic sensitivity.

What are your favorite prods?

"Oz" and "we don't do that". I like "Corleone" also.

You had worked with therapy (producer of Booba then Kaaris) in 2013? Why it is stopped?

Ca has not stopped. Simply, I met Kore and I got everything that I needed. The alchemy was perfect so I have not sought other prods elsewhere. I te swear, when Kore is arrived with his palette of prod, I immediately typed my buttocks by earth.

Compared to your previous sounds, one has the impression that thou hast simplified your lyrics and that thou More Research The Emotion

Ca depends on the pieces in "Oz" Actually, I seeks the emotion. It is true that I have without doubt simplified my lyrics because sometimes when one wants to get out of rhymes very complex, it is to the detriment of the message. In general, I am seeking the perfect rhyme. For me, "Karim" and "gym" it does not rhyme together. And when thou seekest the rime perfect on a 2 or 4 measures, the message is not necessarily. You are obliged to disrupt the words to that it works. It is technical. (It is pretending to install an addition with its hands). If I place this word there, there must be one there, there-bottom. The HBP, it is of maths in fact.



Thou hast generalized use of the autotune also…

Yes I have a lot more put in the album that nowhere elsewhere. In my other EP, I had put that on a few songs. I put the autotune because I am not a singer. I listen to a lot of American sounds and I see that everyone puts. It is enough to think of the future, or French Montana.

Your title "Everybody Wants To of coiled" is quickly becoming a tube on the airwaves. You had designed as a song FM?
